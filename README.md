# AI

This repository contains code done as part of the course "Elements of AI" @ Indiana University. The folder structure is described below:

1) checkers/ : Contains the code where an AI checkers program has been created which always picks the best move bsaed on an optimization function, and searches the state space using alpha-beta pruning.

2) genetic/ : Contains the code where a Genetic algorithm has been implemented with many engineering techinques to obtain a quicker convergence.

3) ticTacToe/ : Contains the an AI engine which can play Tic-tac-Toe. The AI learns to play tic-tac-toe using Q-learning.

4) search/ : It contains the code which uses graph-search techniques like BFS, DFS, A-star, e.t.c, to solve a blocks world problem.
